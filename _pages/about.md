Hello! My name is Yichi Zhang, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at University of Michigan. I advised by Professor [Joyce Chai](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~chaijy/) as a member of the [SLED lab](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection between conversational and embodied AI research, with a particular focus on language grounding to visual and physical contexts， multi-modal dialog, and 3D embodied decision making.

Before joining UMich, I obtained my Master’s in Information and Communication Engineering at Tsinghua University in 2020, advised by Professor [Zhijian Ou](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/ouzhijian/). In 2019, I worked with Professor [Zhou Yu](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zhouyu/) as a visiting scholar on task-oriented dialog systems. I got my Bachelor’s in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Tsinghua University in 2017.
